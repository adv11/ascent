## 1. Project origin & goals

Ascent is a personal roadmap tracker for anyone learning, revising, or tracking
progress toward a goal — students, professionals, or career switchers. New sign-ups
pick a starter template (Issue #51) instead of always getting the original Java
Backend Engineer roadmap: Java Backend Engineer, Frontend Developer, Data Scientist,
or a blank slate to fill in themselves. It started as a personal tool and is moving
toward a sellable product. Correctness and polish are treated as customer-facing, not
side-project-level.

**Current product stage (2026-07):** Phase 0 (Foundation & Standards) complete.
Working through Phase 1 (hosting ✅, auth improvements ✅, brand rename ✅, starter
templates + onboarding ✅ — core architecture hardening continues).

---

## 2. Stack & why each choice was made

| Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Vanilla JS, native ES modules, no bundler | Zero-cost dev startup (`python3 -m http.server 4173`). No build step to fail, no lock-in. Appropriate for a solo MVP moving toward a sellable product where bundle size and framework churn are risks. |
| Firebase Auth (email/password + anonymous) | Covers both the guest "try it now" path and the returning registered user in one SDK. Anonymous sessions can be upgraded to email accounts later without losing progress. |
| Firebase Realtime Database | Per-user roadmap documents, offline-capable, real-time sync, and simple security rules (`auth.uid == $uid`). Simpler than Firestore for a flat `items` map with no query needs. |
| Vitest | Fast, ESM-native, jsdom-integrated. No need for Jest's transform layer on a no-build codebase. |
| Playwright | Chromium E2E with Firebase Emulator — real auth flows without hitting production. |
| No framework (no React, Vue, etc.) | At MVP scale the overhead of a VDOM/reactivity layer exceeds its benefit. The `el()` helper + pub-sub store gives the same mental model at a fraction of the cost. Revisit if component count or state complexity grows past what the store pattern handles cleanly. |

## 3. Module-by-module walkthrough

```
index.html
```
Entry HTML. Contains an **inline no-FOUC theme bootstrap script** that reads
`ascent-theme` (falling back to the pre-rename `switchprep-theme` key) from
`localStorage` and sets `data-theme` on `<html>` before any CSS loads — this prevents
the flash of the wrong theme on a hard reload.

```
src/main.js
```
Boot entry. Initialises theme, wires the Firebase auth state listener, and starts the
hash router. The auth listener calls `roadmapStore.setUser(user)` on every auth change
(sign-in, sign-out, token refresh) — this is the single source of truth for which
user's data is loaded.

```
src/data/roadmap.js
```
Backward-compat shim (Issue #51) — re-exports `PHASES`, `RESOURCE_LIBRARY`,
`TOPIC_RESOURCES`, `ROADMAP_VERSION`, and `buildSeedItems()` from
`src/data/templates/java-backend.js` so every pre-existing import keeps working. No
logic lives here; the actual seed data moved to `src/data/templates/`.

```
src/data/templates/
```
The starter template system (Issue #51). `index.js` is the registry: `TEMPLATES` (id,
name, description, icon, `buildItems()`), `getTemplate(id)`, `buildSeedItems(templateId)`,
and `getTemplatePhases(templateId)`. Each template module (`java-backend.js`,
`frontend.js`, `data-science.js`, `blank.js`) exports its own `PHASES` + `buildSeedItems()`
in the exact shape the original `roadmap.js` used, so `roadmapStore.js` and `dashboard.js`
don't need to know which template is active beyond the id. `java-backend.js` is the
original 500+-item roadmap, moved verbatim — nothing about its content changed.
Templates are loaded via dynamic `import()` (not a static import at the top of
`roadmapStore.js`) specifically so a signed-out visitor on the sign-in page never
downloads roadmap content for templates they haven't picked yet — this file has no
bundler/tree-shaking, so every module is its own network request.

```
src/ui/pages/onboarding.js
```
The `/onboarding` route (Issue #51) — a one-way template picker shown exactly once,
right after a brand-new sign-up, before the dashboard ever renders. No back button.
Renders one card per `TEMPLATES` entry; picking a card calls
`store.initFromTemplate(templateId)` then navigates to `/app`. Self-guards like the
other pages: redirects to `/signin` if there's no user, and to `/app` if
`store.getSnapshot().onboardingDone` is already `true` (e.g. a returning user manually
navigates to `#/onboarding`).

```
src/services/firebase.js
```
Thin wrappers around the Firebase SDK — `authApi` (signIn, signUp, signOut, onAuthChange)
and `dbApi` (listenRoadmap, saveRoadmap, getRoadmap, getMeta, saveMeta). `getRoadmap`/
`getMeta` are one-time `get()` reads (not listeners) used only during `setUser`'s
onboarding-detection step (Issue #51); `listenRoadmap` remains the ongoing real-time
sync mechanism once a user is confirmed onboarded. Keeps SDK coupling in one place so
the rest of the codebase can be tested against the mock in `tests/__mocks__/firebase.js`.

```
src/services/firebase.config.js   (gitignored)
src/services/firebase.config.example.js  (committed template)
```
Real Firebase project credentials live in the gitignored file. Copy the example to that
path and fill in your project's values before running locally. Never commit real credentials.

```
src/services/roadmapStore.js
```
The central state container. Key design decisions:

- **Single mutable `items` map** — all mutations go through named helpers
  (`updateItem`, `addResource`, …) that call `notify()` + `queueSave()`.
- **`subscribe(callback)` / `notify()`** — pub-sub; subscribers receive a snapshot
  `{ items, saveState, structuralVersion, templateId, onboardingDone, phases }`.
- **500 ms debounced `queueSave()`** — writes to `localStorage` immediately and to
  Firebase after the debounce, to avoid hammering the database on every keystroke.
- **`structuralVersion` counter** — see §5.1.
- **`stableStringify` comparison** — see §5.2.
- **`setUser(nextUser)` sign-out guard** — see §5.3.
- **`setUser(nextUser)` is `async` and doubles as onboarding detection** (Issue #51) —
  see §5.7. `main.js` must `await` it before deciding whether to route to `/onboarding`
  or `/app`.
- **`initFromTemplate(templateId)`** — called once by `onboarding.js` after a template
  pick; seeds `items` from that template, sets `templateId`/`onboardingDone`, and starts
  the same debounced-save + realtime-listener sync every other user gets.

```
src/services/theme.js
```
Owns `getTheme()` / `setTheme()` / `toggleTheme()` / `onThemeChange()`, persisted under
`ascent-theme` in `localStorage` (key comes from `localStorageKeys.js`). Follows
`prefers-color-scheme` until the user makes
an explicit choice. Returns an unsubscribe function from `onThemeChange()` — callers must
capture and call it on teardown (see §5.4).

```
src/ui/router.js
```
Tiny hash router (`registerRoute` / `navigate` / `startRouter`). Each route registers a
render function and an optional cleanup function. The router calls cleanup before
switching routes to prevent subscription leaks.

```
src/ui/dom.js
```
`el(tag, attrs, children)` — the only DOM-construction helper. `attrs.className`,
`dataset`, and `text` are special-cased; any `onX` key becomes an `addEventListener`.
Also exports `debounce` and `isValidUrl`. See §5.5 for why `innerHTML` is never used.

```
src/ui/pages/signIn.js
src/ui/pages/signUp.js
```
Auth screens. Both use `authShell.js` for the shared chrome (brand row + theme toggle +
card wrapper) and compose UI entirely with `el()`.

```
src/ui/pages/dashboard.js
```
The roadmap dashboard — effectively the whole app. Renders phase-cards, checklist rows,
progress stats, and wires up the `roadmapStore` subscription. Uses `structuralVersion`
to decide between a full `render()` and the lighter `patchDoneStates()` on each snapshot.
The `data-action` click-guard (§5.6) lives here.

```
src/ui/components/authShell.js
```
Shared chrome for `signIn` and `signUp` — brand row, theme toggle, card wrapper. Returned
as `{ node, cleanup }` so the route can call `cleanup()` on navigation away.

```
src/ui/components/themeToggle.js
```
Reusable dark/light toggle button. Subscribes to `onThemeChange()` and must be cleaned
up — its cleanup is returned from the factory and wired into `main.js`'s route cleanup.

```
src/ui/components/itemPanel.js
```
Slide-in panel for editing a topic and its resource links. Validates resource URLs via
`isValidUrl()` before saving. Opens on "N resources" badge click; closes on backdrop
click or Escape.

```
src/ui/components/toast.js
```
Transient toast notifications. Auto-dismiss after a configurable delay.

```
src/styles/app.css
```
The entire design system — CSS custom properties (tokens) defined once under `:root`
(light mode) and re-defined under `:root[data-theme='dark']`. No hard-coded colors in
component rules — always use a token so both themes stay correct.

```
firebase/database.rules.json
```
Realtime Database security rules. Each user's roadmap is scoped to `users/{uid}` with
`auth != null && auth.uid == $uid` for both reads and writes.

## 4. CI/testing pipeline

| Job | Tool | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| `lint` | ESLint (flat config) | Security rules (no `innerHTML`, no `eval`), unused vars, undefined refs |
| `security` | gitleaks + git ls-files | No committed secrets; `firebase.config.js` not tracked |
| `test-unit` | Vitest + jsdom | Unit and integration tests in `tests/unit/` and `tests/integration/` |
| `test-e2e` | Playwright (Chromium) | End-to-end flows via Firebase Emulator |
| `pr-checklist` | github-script | PR body filled (≥ 50 chars, references an issue); CHANGELOG.md updated when `src/` changes; `docs/architecture.md` Build Log updated when new module added |
| `issues-label-check` | github-script | All three label categories (type/priority/domain) present on new/edited issues |

**Branch protection on `main` (active):** ESLint, Secret scan, Vitest, and PR description
check are all required. E2E (`test-e2e`) is a required check once `FIREBASE_TOKEN` and
`FIREBASE_CONFIG_TEST` secrets are configured (issue #37 completed the emulator wiring;
the secrets are manual steps documented there).

**Pipeline evolution:**
- **PR #38 (issue #30):** Stood up ESLint + Vitest + Playwright + secret scan + branch protection.
- **PR #40 (issue #37):** Wired Firebase Emulator into E2E CI; made `test-e2e` a conditional required check.
- **PR #41 (issue #3):** Added integration tests (12 Vitest tests), coverage thresholds, five `.claude/rules/` files, ADR-001.
- **PR #45 (issue #43):** Extended `pr-checklist` with CHANGELOG + architecture-doc checks; added `issues-label-check` workflow; added `docs-sync` rule.

## 5. Non-obvious conventions & the incidents that produced them

### 5.1 `structuralVersion` — do not regress

`roadmapStore.js` carries a `structuralVersion` counter in every snapshot. Toggling
`done` on an item does **not** bump it — a done-toggle never changes which items exist
or how they are grouped. `dashboard.js`'s `handleSnapshot` runs the full `render()` only
when `structuralVersion` changes; otherwise it calls the lightweight `patchDoneStates()`,
which patches stats and the affected row's classes in place. This eliminates a visible
flash of all phase-cards on every checkbox click.

**Rule:** bump `structuralVersion` for any mutation that changes the *set or shape* of
items (add/remove/reorder/edit fields other than `done`). Don't bump it for cosmetic
changes on an existing row.

Cross-reference: `CLAUDE.md §structuralVersion`.

### 5.2 Firebase echo & `stableStringify`

`dbApi.listenRoadmap`'s `onValue` fires on every write to the path — *including the echo
of writes this client just made* (every debounced save round-trips back through the
listener ~500 ms–1 s after a click). `roadmapStore.js` compares the incoming remote data
against the current in-memory `items` with a key-order-independent `stableStringify`.
Realtime Database returns keys sorted; our in-memory map is insertion-order, so a plain
`JSON.stringify` would produce false positives and bump `structuralVersion` on the echo
— causing the checklist flicker even after the fix, just delayed by a save round-trip.

**Rule:** never replace `stableStringify` with `JSON.stringify` in the echo-detection
comparison, and never make the echo-detection unconditionally bump `structuralVersion`.

Cross-reference: `CLAUDE.md §Watch the Firebase echo`.

### 5.3 Sign-out localStorage guard

`setUser(nextUser)` in `roadmapStore.js` detects when the active `uid` changes. Whenever
`uid` transitions from a non-null value to any other value, it calls `clearLocal()`
(removes both `LOCAL_KEY` and `UI_KEY`) and resets in-memory `items` to `buildSeedItems()`
before the incoming user's session starts. `loadLocal()` is only called for the *incoming*
user, after `uid` is updated.

**Why:** without this guard, signing out as User A and signing in as User B on the same
device would load User A's `localStorage` data into User B's session before the Firebase
fetch completes — a privacy leak on shared devices (issue #23).

Cross-reference: `CLAUDE.md §Sign-out contract`.

### 5.4 Component subscription cleanup

Any component that calls `onThemeChange()` or subscribes to any module-level store must
capture the returned unsubscribe function and call it when the component is torn down.
Pattern: attach to the element as `el._cleanup = unsubscribe`; have the factory return
`{ node, cleanup }`; wire into the route's cleanup return in `main.js`.

Failing to do this leaks dead DOM references and fires callbacks on removed nodes (issue #27).

Cross-reference: `CLAUDE.md §Component subscription cleanup`.

### 5.5 No `innerHTML` — ever

All text must flow through `textContent` (via `el()`'s `text:` key or
`node.textContent = …`). The `html` key was removed from `el()` (issue #22) because it
routed directly to `node.innerHTML`, which is an XSS vector. Resource URLs from the
store must pass `isValidUrl()` before being set as `href` — this blocks `javascript:`
and `data:` URIs.

Cross-reference: `CLAUDE.md §Never use innerHTML` and `.claude/rules/no-innerHTML.json`.

### 5.6 `data-action` click-guard

A checklist row toggles `done` on click. Child controls (Edit button, resource-count
badge) are marked `data-action="…"` and call `e.stopPropagation()` in their own handler.
Any new interactive element nested inside a row must follow this pattern or it will
silently toggle the row's checkbox.

Cross-reference: `CLAUDE.md §data-action click-guard convention`.

### 5.7 Onboarding detection order (Issue #51)

`roadmapStore.js`'s `setUser(nextUser)` is `async` specifically so it can resolve
whether a user still needs the `/onboarding` template picker *before* `main.js` decides
where to route them. On every sign-in it does a one-time `dbApi.getMeta(uid)` +
`dbApi.getRoadmap(uid)` read (not the realtime listener — that only attaches once
onboarding is confirmed done) and evaluates, in order:

1. `remoteMeta.onboardingDone` is `true` → already onboarded; use `remoteMeta.templateId`.
2. The local `ascent-onboarding-done` flag is `true` → already onboarded (fast local
   path, e.g. offline); use the local `ascent-template-id`.
3. Either the remote roadmap or the local roadmap already has an item with
   `custom: true` or `done: true` → this is a pre-existing account from before the
   template system existed. Treat it as onboarded and **backfill**
   `meta.onboardingDone`/`meta.templateId` to Firebase (fire-and-forget — no forced
   migration step, per the issue's Part 5).
4. Otherwise → a genuinely new account. `onboardingDone = false`, `items = {}`, and the
   realtime listener is **not** attached yet (nothing to sync until a template exists).

`main.js`'s auth listener `await`s `setUser` before reading
`store.getSnapshot().onboardingDone` to route to `/onboarding` or `/app` — if this ever
becomes a fire-and-forget call again, the router will act on stale state from the
*previous* user and route incorrectly. `dashboard.js` self-guards on `onboardingDone`
(mirroring the existing `!user` self-guard) so direct hash navigation to `#/app` can't
bypass first-time onboarding. `onboarding.js` itself no longer bounces an already-
onboarded user away — see §5.8, it's a deliberate re-entry point now.

Cross-reference: `CLAUDE.md §Starter templates and onboarding`.

### 5.8 Switching templates and the `stateCallId` stale-call guard (Issue #51 follow-up)

Two gaps surfaced from real-world manual testing of the onboarding picker, fixed in the
same PR before merge:

**No way back.** The picker was originally a strict one-way gate — once a template was
picked, there was no UI path back to it, even to deliberately start over with a
different template. Fixed by adding a **"Switch template"** link to the dashboard
header (`navigate('/onboarding')`) and relaxing `onboarding.js`'s self-guard: it no
longer redirects away when `onboardingDone` is already `true`. Instead, when reached in
that state it shows a **"← Back to my roadmap"** link and wraps the pick handler in a
`confirm()` — since `initFromTemplate()` fully replaces `items`, switching is
destructive and needs explicit confirmation. First-time onboarding
(`onboardingDone === false`) shows neither the back link nor the confirm prompt, since
there is no existing roadmap to lose yet.

**Stale async writes.** `setUser()` and `initFromTemplate()` both `await` a Firebase
round-trip before mutating store state. Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` can fire in
quick succession — most notably, deleting an account and immediately signing up again
with the same email fires it for the old uid (`null`) and the new uid back-to-back. If
an older call's network round-trip happens to resolve *after* a newer call has already
finished, the older call would still go on to overwrite `items`/`templateId`/
`onboardingDone` with its now-stale result — observed as a freshly re-created account
incorrectly skipping the onboarding picker. Fixed with a `stateCallId` counter: every
`setUser`/`initFromTemplate` call captures the counter's value at entry and re-checks it
against the (module-level) current value after each `await`; if a newer call has since
started, the older one returns without touching any state. Any future `await` added to
either function must be followed by the same check before mutating state — see the
`isStale()` helper in `setUser` for the pattern.

Cross-reference: `CLAUDE.md §setUser/initFromTemplate stale-call guard`.

## 6. Deploy checklist

1. Create a Firebase project and copy `src/services/firebase.config.example.js` to
   `src/services/firebase.config.js`, filling in that project's values (gitignored —
   never commit real credentials).
2. Enable Email/Password and Anonymous auth in Firebase Console.
3. Publish Realtime Database rules from `firebase/database.rules.json`.
4. Serve static files (`python3 -m http.server 4173` locally; Firebase Hosting or any
   CDN in production).
5. Enable Firebase App Check before a public launch.
6. Add `FIREBASE_CONFIG_TEST` and `FIREBASE_TOKEN` GitHub secrets to enable E2E CI.

**Future hardening:**
- Move public seed roadmap content to versioned static JSON or a `roadmapTemplates/{version}` node.
- Add server-side validation with Cloud Functions if sharing/community resources are introduced.
- Track analytics events without storing sensitive preparation notes.

## 7. Issue templates & enforcement

`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` contains four GitHub issue forms:

| Template | Use for |
|---|---|
| `feature.yml` | New functionality or user-visible improvement (`type:feat`) |
| `bug.yml` | Something broken (`type:fix`) |
| `chore-refactor.yml` | Maintenance, deps, config, restructuring (`type:chore` / `type:refactor`) |
| `docs.yml` | Documentation improvements (`type:docs`) |

`config.yml` disables blank issues and links to tracker #11 and CLAUDE.md.

The `issues-label-check` workflow (`.github/workflows/issues-label-check.yml`) fires on
`issues.opened` / `issues.edited` and comments on any issue missing a `type:*`,
`priority:*`, or `domain:*` label.

## 8. Build Log

> One entry per significant PR. Append at the bottom. Format:
> `### YYYY-MM-DD — PR #N — <short title>` + what changed architecturally and why.
> This is the developer-facing history; `CHANGELOG.md` is the user-facing one.

### 2026-07-05 — PR #29 — Fix missing import in resource panel (issue #12A)

Fixed a `ReferenceError` thrown on every "Add resource" click. One missing import line
in `itemPanel.js`. No structural change.

### 2026-07-05 — PR #31 — Checklist reliability fixes (issue #2)

Fixed four bugs in `roadmapStore.js` and `dashboard.js`: stale toggle closure, Firebase
echo race, stale snapshot in filter/phase handlers, and phase progress counter lag.
Introduced `structuralVersion` to split render paths (full re-render vs. `patchDoneStates`).

### 2026-07-05 — PR #32 — Sign-out localStorage guard (issue #23)

Added uid-change detection in `setUser()`. On sign-out, `clearLocal()` wipes
`LOCAL_KEY` and `UI_KEY` before the incoming user's session starts. Prevents privacy
leak on shared devices.

### 2026-07-05 — PR #33 — XSS hardening (issue #22)

Removed `innerHTML` usage from `dashboard.js`, deleted the dangerous `html` key from
`el()`, and added `isValidUrl()` validation for all resource URLs rendered as `href`.
Added `.claude/rules/no-innerHTML.json` and `url-validation.json`.

### 2026-07-05 — PR #34 — Theme-toggle subscription cleanup (issue #27)

`themeToggle.js` now returns `{ node, cleanup }`. Routes in `main.js` call `cleanup()`
on navigation. Fixes memory leak from unbounded `onThemeChange` subscribers. Also fixed
static `aria-label` (was never updating to reflect current theme).

### 2026-07-05 — PR #38 — CI quality gate (issue #30)

Stood up the full GitHub Actions pipeline: ESLint (flat config, security rules), Vitest
(17 unit tests, jsdom), Playwright E2E (Chromium), gitleaks secret scan, PR checklist
enforcement, and branch protection on `main`. Added `tests/` directory structure,
`tests/__mocks__/firebase.js`, `tests/setup.js`, `playwright.config.js`,
`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.

### 2026-07-05 — PR #40 — Firebase Emulator E2E CI (issue #37)

Wired Firebase Emulator into the E2E CI job. `firebase.json` emulator config (auth port
9099, database port 9000). Browser SDK connects to emulator when
`window.__USE_FIREBASE_EMULATOR__` is set via Playwright `addInitScript`. Added
`tests/e2e/fixtures.js`. `firebase-tools` added as devDependency.

### 2026-07-05 — PR #41 — Enterprise testing standards & AI-agent rules (issue #3)

Added `tests/integration/roadmapStore.test.js` (12 tests covering subscribe/notify,
structuralVersion contract, sign-out guard, Firebase echo detection). Added coverage
thresholds (20% baseline). Added five `.claude/rules/` JSON files
(`structural-version`, `subscription-cleanup`, `store-pattern`). Added
`docs/adr/ADR-001-current-architecture.md` and `docs/roadmap.md`.

### 2026-07-05 — PR #45 — Living architecture doc & doc-sync enforcement (issue #43)

Rewrote `docs/architecture.md` into this living guide with Build Log. Added four GitHub
issue form templates (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`). Upgraded PR template with Build Log
checkbox and Breaking changes section. Extended `pr-checklist` CI job to fail when `src/`
changes without a `CHANGELOG.md` update or when a new module is added without an
`architecture.md` diff. Added `issues-label-check` workflow. Added `.claude/rules/docs-sync.json`.
Updated `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` with the Living architecture doc convention.

### 2026-07-05 — PR #46 — CSP + SRI + security headers (issue #25)

Three security layers added in one PR:

**Phase A — Firebase Hosting headers**: `firebase.json` extended with a `hosting` block
that sets five HTTP security headers on all routes: HSTS (1 year, includeSubDomains),
`X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`,
`Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, and
`Permissions-Policy` disabling camera/mic/geolocation.

**Phase B — Content Security Policy**: CSP meta tag added to `index.html`. The existing
inline theme-bootstrap IIFE was extracted to `src/services/themeBootstrap.js` (a classic
`<script src="...">` — not a module, so it remains synchronous and preserves the
no-FOUC guarantee). CSP allows `script-src 'self' https://www.gstatic.com`,
`style-src 'self' https://fonts.googleapis.com`, `font-src https://fonts.gstatic.com`,
`connect-src` covering Firebase Realtime Database, Auth, and token-refresh endpoints,
and `frame-ancestors 'none'` (belt-and-suspenders with X-Frame-Options).

**Phase C — SRI for Firebase SDK**: `<link rel="modulepreload" integrity="sha384-...
crossorigin="anonymous">` entries added for all three Firebase SDK modules. Hashes
computed at implementation time via `openssl dgst -sha384 -binary | base64`. SDK upgrade
process documented in ADR-002 and CLAUDE.md.

New files: `src/services/themeBootstrap.js`, `docs/adr/ADR-002-csp-sri-security.md`,
`tests/unit/themeBootstrap.test.js`.

### 2026-07-05 — PR #TBD — Firebase Hosting + CI/CD (issue #28)

**Platform**: Firebase Hosting (Spark free tier) chosen over Cloudflare Pages and Netlify
because Auth + Realtime Database already live in the same Firebase project. One CLI, one
dashboard, one billing account. ADR-003 documents the tradeoffs and the Cloudflare Pages
migration path if bandwidth grows.

**`firebase.json`** extended from emulator-only to a full hosting config:
- `ignore` list keeps dev/doc files (CLAUDE.md, tests/, docs/, package.json, etc.) off the CDN
- `rewrites` rule `"source": "**" → "/index.html"` enables SPA hash-router on direct URL access
- `Cache-Control` per route: `no-cache` for `index.html` (always-fresh entry point), `max-age=31536000, immutable` for `/src/**` and `*.css` (cache-busted by the fresh HTML reference)
- Security headers on `**`: HSTS, X-Frame-Options: DENY, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy (supersedes the security-headers-only version from PR #46 / issue #25)
- `database.rules` wired so `firebase deploy` also updates Realtime DB Security Rules

**`.firebaserc`** added with a `YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` placeholder — must be set to the real project ID before deploying.

**`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`** added: `FirebaseExtended/action-hosting-deploy@v0`
triggered on push to `main` (live channel) and on PRs (temporary channel, expires 7d). Deploy
steps are guarded by a readiness check — if `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` is not set, the
workflow prints instructions and exits cleanly rather than failing. Required setup:
- `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` (secret) — service account JSON from Firebase Console
- `FIREBASE_CONFIG` (secret) — production `firebase.config.js` contents
- `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` (variable) — project ID (non-sensitive)

### 2026-07-05 — PR #TBD — Email verification, persistent sessions, account deletion (issue #14)

**New module**: `src/ui/components/verificationBanner.js` — dismissible info bar shown on
the dashboard when the signed-in user's email is not yet verified. Dismiss state is stored
in `sessionStorage` keyed by `ascent-verify-dismissed-{uid}` so it persists across
navigations but clears on browser close.

**`src/services/firebase.js`** extended with three new `authApi` methods:
- `sendVerificationEmail()` — wraps `sendEmailVerification(auth.currentUser)`; called best-effort
  after sign-up (error is swallowed so a transient Firebase failure never blocks account creation)
- `setPersistence(rememberMe)` — switches between `browserLocalPersistence` (default, survives
  restart) and `browserSessionPersistence` (tab-only); called in signIn.js before the sign-in
  call so persistence is set before the credential exchange
- `deleteAccount(password)` — re-authenticates with `reauthenticateWithCredential`, then deletes
  `users/{uid}` from Realtime Database *before* calling `deleteUser` (reversing this order leaves
  orphaned database data)

**`src/ui/pages/dashboard.js`**: mounts `verificationBanner` above the offline banner;
adds a "Delete account" button (non-anonymous users only) that opens an inline confirmation modal
with password re-entry — no native `confirm()`.

**`src/ui/pages/signIn.js`**: "Keep me signed in" checkbox (checked by default) calls
`authApi.setPersistence` before sign-in.

### 2026-07-05 — PR #TBD — Auth form UX hardening (issue #26)

**New module**: `src/ui/utils/password.js` — two exports used by both auth pages:
- `scorePassword(s)` — pure function returning 0–4; 0 for empty/too-short, 1 base for
  ≥6 chars, +1 for ≥8, +1 for ≥12, +1 for mixed case, +1 for digit, +1 for special char
  (capped at 4). No external library.
- `makePasswordToggle(input)` — factory returning an absolutely-positioned `<button>`
  that toggles `input.type` between `'password'` and `'text'` and updates `aria-label`.
  Caller wraps the input in `.field-input-wrap` (CSS `position: relative`).

**`src/ui/pages/signUp.js`**: added confirm-password field with real-time mismatch
validation (fires on `input` event and on submit before any Firebase call); 4-segment
strength meter driven by `scorePassword`; show/hide toggles on both password fields;
"Continue as guest" divider + button (matching sign-in). Labels changed to "Create a
password" / "Confirm password".

**`src/ui/pages/signIn.js`**: show/hide toggle added to the password field.

**`src/styles/app.css`**: new classes `.field-input-wrap`, `.password-toggle`,
`.strength-meter`, `.strength-segment`, `.strength-segment.weak/.fair/.strong`,
`.field-error`.

### 2026-07-06 — PR #TBD — Product rename to Ascent, brand system, localStorage key migration (issue #7)

**New module**: `src/ui/components/brand.js` — single source of truth for the wordmark.
Exports `createBrandIcon()` / `createBrandWordmark()` / `createBrandMark({ tagline })`.
Replaces the `✓`-glyph markup that was previously duplicated inline in both
`authShell.js` and `dashboard.js` with a shared inline SVG triangle (filled with
`currentColor` so `.brand-mark`'s CSS still controls the color). `el()` only creates
HTML elements (`document.createElement`), so `brand.js` adds its own tiny local
`svgEl()` helper (`document.createElementNS`) rather than changing the shared `dom.js`
contract, since nothing else in the app needs SVG creation.

**New modules**: `src/services/localStorageKeys.js` (canonical `KEYS` object +
`verifyDismissedKey(uid)`) and `src/services/migration.js`
(`migrateLocalStorageKeys()`), called at the top of `main.js` before `initTheme()`.
Renaming `switchprep-theme` / `switchprep-roadmap-v3` / `switchprep-ui-v3` without a
migration would have silently reset every existing user's theme and roadmap progress
on their next visit. `src/services/themeBootstrap.js` (a classic script that runs
before `main.js`'s migration ever gets a chance to) reads `ascent-theme` first and
falls back to `switchprep-theme`, so first paint is still correct pre-migration.

**New assets**: `public/favicon.svg` (hand-written, matches `.brand-mark`'s existing
40×40 / `rx: 12` / teal→cyan gradient exactly), plus `public/favicon-32.png`,
`public/apple-touch-icon.png`, `public/icon-192.png`, `public/icon-512.png`,
`public/og-image.png`, and `public/manifest.json`. The PNGs and OG image are generated
by `scripts/generate-brand-assets.mjs` (dev-only, run via
`npm run generate:brand-assets`), which uses the already-installed
`@playwright/test` Chromium to screenshot `favicon.svg` at each required size —
pixel-consistent with the in-app icon rather than redrawn by hand. `index.html` gains
`<link rel="icon"/manifest/apple-touch-icon>`, `theme-color`, and `og:*` meta tags;
none existed before this PR.

**Deferred** (see `docs/adr/ADR-004-product-rename.md`): the GitHub repository rename
is Issue #10; Firebase Console changes (project display name, Auth email templates,
custom action-URL domain) are manual, non-code steps documented as a checklist on the
closing PR.

### 2026-07-06 — PR #TBD — Starter template system, new-user onboarding picker (issue #51)

**New directory**: `src/data/templates/` — the starter template registry (`index.js`:
`TEMPLATES`, `getTemplate`, `buildSeedItems(templateId)`, `getTemplatePhases(templateId)`)
plus four template modules: `java-backend.js` (the original roadmap, moved verbatim from
`src/data/roadmap.js`), `frontend.js`, `data-science.js`, and `blank.js` (four empty
phases, no seeded topics). `src/data/roadmap.js` is now a thin re-export shim pointing at
`templates/java-backend.js` — every existing import of it keeps working unchanged.
Templates load via dynamic `import()` so the sign-in/sign-up pages never download roadmap
content the visitor hasn't picked yet.

**New route/page**: `src/ui/pages/onboarding.js` (`/onboarding`) — a template picker
shown once, right after a brand-new sign-up (no back link or confirmation needed then,
since there's nothing to lose yet). Renders one card per registered template with a
live item count (fetched async per card), and calls the new
`roadmapStore.initFromTemplate(templateId)` on selection. Also reachable later via the
dashboard's new "Switch template" link — see the follow-up note below.

**`src/services/roadmapStore.js`**: `setUser(nextUser)` is now `async`. It performs a
one-time `dbApi.getMeta` + `dbApi.getRoadmap` read to decide `onboardingDone` before
attaching the realtime `listenRoadmap` listener — see §5.7 for the full detection order,
including the Part 5 backfill for every pre-existing account. Snapshots now also carry
`templateId`, `onboardingDone`, and `phases` (the active template's phase/section
skeleton). New `initFromTemplate(templateId)` seeds items from a chosen template and
starts syncing.

**`src/services/firebase.js`**: `dbApi` gains `getRoadmap`/`getMeta` (one-time `get()`
reads) and `saveMeta` (partial `update()` of `users/{uid}/meta`), alongside the existing
`listenRoadmap`/`saveRoadmap`.

**`firebase/database.rules.json`**: added validation for `users/{uid}/meta/templateId`
(string) and `meta/onboardingDone` (boolean).

**`src/ui/pages/dashboard.js`**: `groupItems()` now takes the active template's phase
skeleton (`store.getSnapshot().phases`) as a parameter instead of a hardcoded `PHASES`
import, and a section with zero total items (as opposed to zero items *after* a
filter/search) always stays visible — otherwise the "blank" template's four empty phases
would never render a phase-card at all. Also self-guards on `!store.getSnapshot().onboardingDone`
the same way it already self-guards on `!user`.

**Copy**: the dashboard search input's placeholder ("Search topics, e.g. Kafka, RAG,
Saga…") was the last Java-specific string outside the templates themselves; changed to
"Search topics…".

**Follow-up fixes from manual testing, same PR**: (1) added a "Switch template" link to
the dashboard header and relaxed `onboarding.js`'s self-guard so it no longer redirects
an already-onboarded user away — reached that way it shows a "← Back to my roadmap"
link and a `confirm()` before replacing the roadmap (see §5.8); (2) fixed a real
concurrency bug where a slow, superseded `setUser()` call could resolve after a newer
one and clobber its state — most reproducible by deleting an account and immediately
signing up again with the same email — via a `stateCallId` generation guard shared with
`initFromTemplate()` (see §5.8); (3) substantially expanded `frontend.js` (116 → 230
topics) and `data-science.js` (80 → 166 topics) to match the Java Backend template's
depth, adding a `TOPIC_RESOURCES` map to both.
